        <p> The academic year can be a whirlwind of assignments, exams, and extracurricular activities. It's essential to prioritize self-care and find effective ways to unwind and prevent burnout. Here are a few relaxation tips to help you stay grounded and focused throughout the year.</p>
        <p>One of the most effective ways to relax is through mindfulness and meditation. These practices involve focusing on the present moment and letting go of worries and stress. Even a few minutes of deep breathing or guided meditation can significantly reduce anxiety and improve your overall well-being. Additionally, engaging in physical activities like yoga, walking, or dancing can help you relax your body and mind. Exercise releases endorphins, which are natural mood boosters, and can also improve your sleep quality.</p>
